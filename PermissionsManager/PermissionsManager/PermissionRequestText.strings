/*Naming scheme
 
 ------------
 - PREFIXES -
 ------------
 Each type of permission has a certain prefix, defined here:
 PREFIX             PERMISSION TYPE
 - Default          Default             //This is used if there is no specifically defined property for the permission type
 - AlwaysLocation   LocationServicesAlways
 - InUseLocation    LocationServicesInUse
 - Photos           Photo Library
 - Push             Push Notifications
 (this list will be updated as I add more permission types)
 
 -----------------
 - ELEMENT NAMES -
 -----------------
 This defines names for each part of the interface
 NAME               ELEMENT AFFECTED
 - RequestMessage   The message displayed to the user
 - GrantButton      The button that grants permission
 - DelayButton      The button that delays permission
 - ImageName        The name of the image
 
 -------------
 - POSTFIXES -
 -------------
 This defines the postfixes that can be added on, currently only used for if permission has already been requested or if there are restrictions on the user's account
 POSTFIX            DESCRIPTION
 - RequestAgain     Permission already been requested
 - Restricted       User has restrictions on their phone
 
 -------------
 - COMBINING -
 -------------
 Combining the prefix, element name, and postfix is simple. An _ is always used to separate the sections. If no postfix is used, there is no need for a final underscore.
 
 For examples, see the default text below. There should ALWAYS be defaults in place to fall back on should other types of permissions not be defined, or be defined incorrectly.
 
 ---------
 - FLAGS -
 ---------
 There are certain values that will cause the interface to change. These should begin with an asterisk "*" and be in all capital letters with no whitespace or underscores. (Please note, this does mean that if you want to begin your message/button title with an asterisk, you must precede it with a backslash "\*")
 FLAG       PURPOSE
 - HIDDEN   Using the *HIDDEN flag will cause that element to not be displayed to the user (this is only recommeneded for use on the ImageName and GrantButton – the user should always be shown a message)
